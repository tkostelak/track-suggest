        <h5>Learning how to program might seem stressful because there are so many different coding languages to choose from! The truth is, don't be too worried. It is really common for employers to switch languages on their employees, and you might also find that there are other areas of programming that you are more passionate than you thought! Therefore, learning any programming language is going to be beneficial to you. Once you've learned one language, it's always easier to learn another.</h5>
        <br>
        <h5>While it is great to learn essentially any programming language, you'll thank yourself in the long run if you narrow down the strengths of different programming languages, and determine which strengths apply most to your needs.</h5>

        <h5>Take this quiz to find out if you should learn C#, Java, or Ruby!</h5>
